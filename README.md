# Numen
### What is Numen?
Numen is a hobby project of mine. Just for deeper understanding \
of math and the C programming language, nothing big. Anyone is \
invited to roast my code in the issues.
### How to contribute to Numen?
Change the code and make a pull request. And there you are, you've \
contributed to numen. Fun? Yeah, really! But make sure that you've \
added your details in the CONTRIBUTORS.md file. Just to know my \
fellow programmers. Before, I take my leave, if you have any \
experience with DOXYGEN than add doxygen comments in your code. \
Otherwise, be sure to mention that you haven't in the pull request.\
Have Fun, See ya!
