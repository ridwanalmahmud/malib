# Numen
### What is Numen?
Numen is a hobby project of mine. Just for deeper understanding of\
math and the C programming language, nothing big. Anyone is invited to\
roast my code in the issues.
### How to contribute to Numen?
Change the code and make a pull request. And there you are, you've\
contributed to numen. Fun? Yeah, really! But make sure that you've\
added your details in the CONTRIBUTORS.txt file. Just to know my  fellow\
programmers. Before, I take my leave, if you have any  experience with\
DOXYGEN than add doxygen comments in your code. Otherwise, be sure to\
mention that you haven't in the pull request. Word of advice, just give\
your code to chatgpt and tell the guy to generate doxygen comments.\
Much easier and faster.
Have Fun, See ya!
